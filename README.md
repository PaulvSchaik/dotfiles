My system and a lot of my config files. 
Daily user of: 

*Kitty:* The one-and-only modern terminal for linux
*Hyprland:* A beautifull wayland compositor (and/or window manager)
*ranger:* file manger done right
*Neovim:* Lua configured nvim for evnerything you can type on and in
*rofi-wayland:* Because "have you seen wofi?"
*waybar:* Sometimes you just need some visual feedback
*SwayNotificationCenter:* swaync, tried it, configured it, liked it...
*Google Chrome:* Yes, the evil one!

*Steam:* To relax, you sometimes have to play a game. Running SteamOS in a Distrobox container to keep all the 32bit and other junk out of my running system.

I like building my own apps from source and use a Fedora 40 Distrobox container for this with al the build tools installed.

*terminal/shell tools:* fzf, fd, zsh-autosuggestions, zsh-thefuck, zsh-syntax-highlighting, zsh-autocomplete and I'm running the Pure prompt.
